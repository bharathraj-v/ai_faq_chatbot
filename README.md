# Bank FAQ Chatbot
A generic chatbot that answers frequently asked questions for a bank. Built using Dense Neural Network.

**Dense Neural Networks**: A dense neural network, also known as a fully connected neural network, is a type of neural network in which all the nodes in one layer are connected to all the nodes in the next layer. This means that each node in the input layer is connected to every node in the hidden layer, and each node in the hidden layer is connected to every node in the output layer. In a dense neural network, there are no skipped connections or disconnected nodes.

A Dense Neural Network is trained upon the intents from intents.json file that contains answers for Frequently Asked Questions
